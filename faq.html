                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Beef tallow is rendered suet (leaf) fat from cattle. This most nutrient rich fat has been used for centuries as an excellent moisturiser because it's soft by nature, has a high lipid content and is uniquely bio compatible with our own skin cell structure allowing for seamless absorption compared to plant-based oils.</p>
                            <p>100% Grass-fed, chemical free tallow, is particularly beneficial, as it boasts a higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, to nourish & supporting skin health.</p>
                            <p>Cattle, who are frequently rotated through fresh & diverse, chemical free, nutrient rich pastures like ours are, enjoy improved health & welfare, and contribute to regenerative and sustainable farming practices that reduce environmental impact, and support bio diverse eco systems to thrive.</p>
                            <p>These practises result in a cleaner, safer product, free from hormones, antibiotics & chemicals—richer in beneficial nutrients.</p>
                            <p>We believe Organic Grass-fed Tallow is Natures skin food. It's safe for the whole family and an ideal choice for holistic & responsible skin care.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>The best tallow is made from the rich, 'Leaf fat' or 'Suet', which means the fat that directly surrounds the liver and kidney organs. It's the best fat to use because its richly dense in nutrients and minerals and is, 'soft' by nature. The best quality Leaf fat is derived from not only 100% grass-fed cattle, but also from organically raised cattle. This ensures the end product is of high quality & pure.</p>

                            <p>We add a small amount of Organic, extra virgin-cold pressed olive oil to the Frankincense and Lavender Essential Oil Blends.</p>
                            <p>We add cold-pressed almond oil to our Vanilla Essential Oil Blend.</p>
                            <p>All of these products are locally and organically sourced, and are divine to work with!</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Our tallow-based skincare products are uniquely crafted to naturally harness the rich benefits of tallow. It's abundance of essential fatty acids and vitamins A, D, E, and K. These nutrients are vital for deeply nourishing and protecting the skin. Tallow closely mimics the skin's natural oils, providing superior hydration, repairing the skin barrier, and promoting a healthy, radiant glow.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>In your VERY FIRST APPLICATION of Tallow Balm your skin will feel deeply moisturised, nourished & supported in a way it has never felt before. Many hours after application your skin will still feel soft because tallow is rich in bioavailable nutrients that absorb effortlessly by nature without clogging or disrupting your natural barrier.</p>
                            <p>You'll notice: a calm, hydrated glow, a softer supple texture, and a lasting sense of balance. Without synthetic or toxic ingredients — just pure, unaltered organic ingredients your skin recognises and responds to.</p>
                            <p>There's a sense of alignment and satisfaction that comes from knowing your skin is being supported in the most natural, biocompatible way possible — free from harsh chemicals, preservatives, or hormone-disrupting additives.</p>
                            <p>That your purchase is your vote for supporting ethical and sustainable farming practises.</p>

Its natural composition helps balance oil production and soothes irritation, making it an excellent choice for anyone seeking to maintain a healthy skin barrier & keep skin well-nourished.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>At Chantilly's Tallow, we are passionate about ethical and sustainable practises, about maintaining integrity and growing a business that flows in rhythm with nature.</p>
                            <p>We only source raw product from our own regeneratively farmed cattle and one other like-minded family friends farm in South Gippsland Victoria.</p>
                            <p>Our pastures are chemical-free, we use natural wormers and our cattle are all processing on site without added stress.</p>
                            <p>We know that this deep commitment to maintain such high standards means we are only able to grow as large as the raw materials we can source.</p>
                            <p>If we are willing to work with nature, the seasons of with and without and remain true to our values, not compromising for monetary needs, to be at peace with, this is enough, and all will be well, we believe we are claiming the possibility of a future where holistic approaches and practises have space to thrive, be birthed, nurtured and rooted in deeper alignment with nature.</p>
                            <p>This is a way we can do our part to create a more connected world for our children to raise their children in.</p>

                            <p><strong>How Our Tallow is Made – With Love, By Hand</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Fresh from the Source</strong> – We start with the freshest leaf fat, delivered the same day it's harvested.</p>
                            <p><strong>Render with Care</strong> – The fat is chopped, grated, or minced, then slowly rendered at low temperatures using pure spring water that we hand-collect from a nearby natural spring.</p>
                            <p><strong>4x Rendered</strong> – This careful rendering process is repeated four times until the fat becomes fully liquefied.</p>
                            <p><strong>Filtered to Perfection</strong> – The liquid tallow is poured through a double-layered cheesecloth to remove impurities.</p>
                            <p><strong>Settling Stage</strong> – Once set, the oil and water separate. We drain off the water and gently scrape away any remaining sediment.</p>
                            <p><strong>Do It All Again</strong> – Yes, we repeat the process four times to achieve an ultra-clean, creamy, odourless tallow.</p>
                            <p><strong>Blended with Goodness</strong> – The final tallow is reheated gently, then blended with nourishing oils like olive or almond, and infused with essential oils.</p>
                            <p><strong>Let It Rest</strong> – We allow the blend to reset… tic toc tic toc.</p>
                            <p><strong>Whipped to Perfection</strong> – Finally, we whip it into a silky, luxurious cream that looks good enough to eat — especially the vanilla-scented one!</p>
                            <p>This part never gets old. Watching it come together, filling the jars with soft, fragrant goodness, and hearing your stories of how much you love it — that's why we keep making it.</p>
                            <p>We hope you enjoy it just as much as we enjoy creating it for you.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3 class="faq-question">Why do we only create Whipped Tallow Balms?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Because we believe Whipped Tallow is much better to use.</p>
                            <p>Its definitely lighter to apply, feels softer, creamier, is more luxurious and divine.</p>
                            <p>Whipped tallow is more versatile for a day and night cream, while many people attest to applying unwhipped balms only in the evening as they are heavier and sometimes greasier than a whipped version.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes we definitely wish we weren't so attached to the whipped balms though because they are much trickier to produce. They require 20% more processing time, can be less stable, more affected by temp changes, and re settle, a little lower in the jars at times.</p>
                            <p>They need to be made in smaller batches at a time to order rather than pre made in advance.</p>
                            <p>We have 95% sorted all these anomalies with extra care, work and processes, of course. Glass jars are massively helpful providing that extra insulation layer.</p>
                            <p>If you have any issues do let us know, our hope is that if you love the whip as much as us, a little re settling from time to time is a small price to pay!</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3 class="faq-question">Why do most Tallow companies only offer unwhipped?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Unwhipped tallow balms are easier to produce, more stable, less production cost, ie work/time. Requiring 20% less production time.</p>
                            <p>They are poured in jars/tins at a melting temp/warm to hot. (don't buy in aluminum)</p>
                            <p>They're easier to jar up, have a stable consistency and no further settling issues in the jar.</p>
                            <p>Whipping Tallow balms to us, is like heirloom fruits and veg you can only enjoy if you grow your own, because they aren't as commercially viable like produce that can be pre-picked, pre-made in large batches, and stored for a longer period of time.</p>
                            <p>Do you think whipping is worth it?</p>
