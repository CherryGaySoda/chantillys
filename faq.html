                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>The best tallow is made from the rich, 'Leaf fat' or 'Suet' which means the fat that directly surrounds the liver and kidney organs.</p>
                            <p>It's the best fat to use because it's rich in 'skin-food' nutrients and minerals and is 'soft' by nature. Our beef-fat is exceptional quality because it is derived from Organically-raised, 100% Grass fed cattle, from our own farm and from like-minded ethical farmers we know & trust.</p>
                            <p>We process the fat at low temperature, and purify it 4x in spring water to preserve its innate nutrients and ensure the end product you receive is of high quality & pure.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>For Frankincense & Lavender, Scent-Free & Cedarwood Essential Oil Blends:</strong></p>
                            <p>We add a small amount of locally sourced Organic, extra virgin cold-pressed olive oil.</p>
                            <p><strong>For Vanilla Essential Oil Blend:</strong></p>
                            <p>We add Organic cold-pressed almond oil.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Organic, Grass-fed Tallow is the perfect all-in-one moisturizer for both face and body. Its unique composition is loaded with fat-soluble nutrients which are bio-compatible with human skin, meaning it mimics the structure of our own skin cells.</p>
                            <p>This allows Tallow to absorb deeply and deliver long-lasting nourishment — naturally.</p>
                            <blockquote>"I used to use four skincare products twice a day… now I only use Tallow, and my skin has never been better."</blockquote>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes! Our tallow comes from 100% grass-fed, organically-raised cattle from our own farm and trusted local suppliers. We never use cattle that have been given hormones, antibiotics, or chemical inputs.</p>
                            <p>All our additional ingredients (olive oil, almond oil, essential oils) are also organic and locally sourced whenever possible.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>No! Because tallow is bio-compatible with human skin (it closely mimics our skin's natural oils), it absorbs easily without clogging pores. Many customers with acne-prone skin find that tallow actually helps balance their skin.</p>

                            <p>Our purification process removes the natural tallow scent, creating an odorless base. Our scent-free version has no added fragrance at all.</p>
                            <p>Our scented versions have subtle, natural aromas from organic essential oils (lavender, frankincense, cedarwood, or vanilla).</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Use it just like any moisturizer! A little goes a long way. Warm a small amount between your fingers and apply to clean, slightly damp skin on your face and/or body.</p>
                            <p>It can be used morning and night, and is suitable for all skin types.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Tallow is stable at room temperature but may soften in warm weather. If it gets too soft, simply refrigerate briefly to firm it up.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes! Many people with sensitive skin find tallow to be gentler than conventional moisturizers because it contains no harsh chemicals, preservatives, or synthetic ingredients.</p>
                            <p>Our scent-free option is particularly good for very sensitive skin.</p>

                            <p>We use rotational grazing systems on our 100-acre farm in Gippsland, Victoria. This allows the soil to regenerate, increases biodiversity, and improves pasture quality while supporting healthy cattle and local ecosystems.</p>
                            <p>We honor our cattle by applying the 'nose-to-tail' philosophy of no waste.</p>
